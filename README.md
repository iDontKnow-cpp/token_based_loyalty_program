This is a token-based loyalty program concept where users can earn tokens for each transfer and redeem them for gifts cards or in app benefits. On a larger scale, users can earn tokens for buying cryptos, based on the number of cryptos purchased, transferred, swapped, bridged, and more.

Upon creating an account user receives 100 cryptos.
User recieves 3 tokens for each transaction, after successful completion of 10 transactions user receives 5 tokens for each transaction.
Gas fee of 0.3% is applied on each transaction.
After collecting a total of 1000 tokens user can redeem for a gift card (disclaimer, it is just a concept program, your not actually gonna get one).
