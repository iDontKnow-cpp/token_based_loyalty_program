# Token-Based Loyalty Program (Blockchain Concept)

This project outlines a conceptual **token-based loyalty program** built on blockchain principles. It enables users to **earn tokens** for on-chain activities such as transfers, purchases, swaps, and more—encouraging user engagement and crypto adoption.

## 🎯 Program Highlights

- **New Account Bonus:**  
  Users receive `100 cryptos` upon account creation.

- **Transaction Rewards:**  
  - Earn `3 tokens` per transaction.  
  - After successfully completing `10 transactions`, the reward increases to `5 tokens` per transaction.

- **Token Redemption:**  
  - Users can **redeem 1000 tokens** for a gift card or in-app benefits.  
  - _(Note: This is a conceptual feature. No real rewards are distributed.)_

- **Gas Fee:**  
  A flat `0.3%` gas fee is applied to every transaction.

## 💡 Use Cases (Scalable)

Tokens can also be earned through:
- Crypto purchases  
- Asset swaps  
- Token bridging  
- Cross-chain interactions
